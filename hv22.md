# Write-up Hackvent 2022

[TOC]

## Intro and credits

This is my write-up for the 2022 Hackvent on hacking-lab.com.
Hackvent is a remote, public and free-to-play jeopardy-style CTF.
Each day during advent, one challenge gets released. 
As christmas approaches, the difficulty of every new challenge increases by a bit. 
You can read more about it [here](https://hacking-lab.com/events/hackvent-2022#what-is-hackvent).

Hackvent is organised by Compass Security and many volunteers contributing challenges and maintaining infrastructure for things to work smoothly.

I want to thank everyone for letting me learn and discover new fields and unknown corners of already explored areas. Thanks a lot kuyaya for keeping challenges stable and hackers engaged.

This year, I approached the web3 challenges as purely educational, but with a goal of solving them all as I wanted to aquire more knowledge in this area - many thanks to HaCk0 for your challenges and to mcia for helping me getting unstuck many times. I learned a ton of new stuff thanks to you.

Further credits go to all the challenge creators for the awesome challenges and of course to all the hackers for solving them (especially the ones where I gave up from the outset).

Finally, I want to thank my family as this was again another layer on top of an already busy December.

Happy reading,
