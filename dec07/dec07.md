## Description

Santa has found a weird device called an "Oxocard Blockly", which seems to display a sequence of images. He believes it has got something to do with a QR code, but it doesn't seem complete...

You can't fly to the north pole, so Santa sent you a video of the device in action.

The elves are having a karaoke and left with in a hurry while singing into their micro. This means that they aren't there to help him, so now is your chance to make a good impression and find the flag!

See [Video](https://youtu.be/thkeQU0CXyI).

## Solution
The video show four sections of a micro-QR code and how to assemble them back to a readable QR code.

Do so and get the following image:

## Notes
