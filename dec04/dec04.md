## Description
Santa, who is a passionate mathematician, has created a small website to train his animation coding skills. Although Santa lives in the north pole, where the degrees are very low, the website's animation luckily did not freeze. It just seems to move very slooowww. But how does this help...? The elves think there might be a flag in the application...

## Solution
